You will need the standard data science libraries found in the [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is to analyse the Kaggle Titanic dataset. Specifically, I looked at the following questions:

1. What were the factors that made people survive?
2. What is the average age of passengers on board?
3. How is the distribution of passengers on the ship by class?
4. What is the average age of the passengers who survived?
5. What is the average sex of the passengers who survived?
6. What class of passengers survived?
