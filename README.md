## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You will need the standard data science libraries found in the [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is to analyse the Kaggle Titanic dataset. Specifically, I looked at the following questions:

1. What is the mean age of passengers on board?
2. How is the distribution of passengers on the ship by class?
3. What is the mean sex of the passengers who survived?
4. What class of passengers survived?
5. What is the mean age of the passengers who survived?
6. What were the factors that made people survive?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The following are the files available in this repository:

* `Titanic_Dataset.ipynb` - a notebook of the analysis performed following the CRISP-DM process

* `titanic-data-6.csv` - contains the data analysed by the .ipynb file. To use it properly put it in the same directory as the .ipynb file.
